# Configuring-SMTP-FTP-and-DNS-Network-Services

*** Networking Lab: SMTP, FTP, and DNS Server Configuration

This project is a hands-on networking lab focused on the configuration and testing of three essential network services: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and DNS (Domain Name System). The goal is to understand how these services work individually and together to support daily internet functionalities such as emailing, file sharing, and accessing websites.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the core functionality of SMTP, FTP, and DNS in networking.
- Learn to set up and configure each server type.
- Perform testing to validate proper functionality.
- Troubleshoot and resolve common configuration errors.
- Gain real-world experience in managing internet protocols.

---

## ⚙️ Services Configured

### ✅ SMTP Server
- Sends emails between users.
- Configured to allow test message delivery.

### ✅ FTP Server
- Enables uploading and downloading of files.
- Verified with successful file transfer tests.

### ✅ DNS Server
- Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- Successfully tested with domain lookups.

## 🧪 Experimental Procedure

1. Install required software for SMTP, FTP, and DNS services.
2. Set up the **SMTP server** for sending emails.
3. Configure the **FTP server** for file transfer.
4. Set up the **DNS server** for resolving domain names.
5. Test all services:
   - Send test emails using SMTP.
   - Upload/download files with FTP.
   - Resolve domain names with DNS.
6. Troubleshoot any issues and ensure all services function correctly.

## 🗨️ Discussion

Through this experiment, the following were observed:

- Emails were successfully sent using the configured SMTP server.
- Files were uploaded and downloaded efficiently via FTP.
- DNS resolved domain names correctly to their respective IP addresses.

### Challenges:
- Initial SMTP setup issues (port and authentication errors) were resolved using online documentation and tutorials.

### Key Learning:
- SMTP, FTP, and DNS are foundational services for internet communication.
- Proper configuration and testing are essential for reliable service performance.
- Real-world networking requires a good understanding of these protocols for effective troubleshooting.
